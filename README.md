# Go Learning

## I've categorised it into phases

### *Phase 1*

#### Includes the following topics

+ Variables and data types
+ Basic Syntax
+ Control Structure (If/Else, Switch Case)
+ The versatile For Loop
+ Pointers
+ Very basic recursion

### *Phase 2*

#### Includes slightly more advanced topics

+ Structs
  + Fields
  + Methods
  + Mutation Methods
  + Creation/Constructor Functions (This is more of a pattern)
  + Struct Embeddings (A similar thing like Inheritance)
    + Can be anonymous
    + Can be "key type" representation too both vary
